        <h4>
            Summary: The checkbox does not work correctly 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Steps to reproduce:
            <ul>
               <li>uncheck all the race categories</li>
               <li>verify the stage of the result</li>
            </ul>
            Expected result:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When no filter applied, there should be no content / race displayed
                </li>
            </ul>
            Actual Result:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When the 3rd checkbox unchecked, all categories get checked.
                </li>
            </ul>
